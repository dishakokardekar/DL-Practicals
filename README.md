Title: American Sign Language Interpreter Using DenseNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3.
Problem Statement: Effective communication is vital for everyone, including those who use American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary means of communication. However, there can be barriers when interacting with individuals who are not fluent in ASL. To bridge this communication gap, there is a need for an accurate and efficient ASL interpreter that can translate ASL gestures into text or spoken language. Traditional interpreters may not always be available, leading to delays or misunderstandings. Leveraging deep learning models such as DenseNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3 can automate the interpretation process, providing real-time translation and enhancing accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing community.
Explanation: In this project, my aim is to develop an ASL interpreter using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: DenseNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3. These architectures have been widely used and proven effective in various computer vision tasks, making them suitable candidates for ASL gesture recognition.
1.	DenseNet: DenseNet stands out for its densely connected layers, where each layer receives input from all preceding layers. This dense connectivity encourages feature reuse and facilitates gradient flow during training, leading to improved model performance. In the context of ASL interpretation, DenseNet's ability to capture intricate spatial relationships within gestures can be advantageous.

2.	MobileNet: MobileNet is designed for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices or embedded systems. It achieves efficiency through depth-wise separable convolutions, which significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving accuracy. MobileNet's lightweight architecture makes it well-suited for real-time applications like ASL interpretation, where speed and efficiency are crucial.

3.	InceptionV3: InceptionV3 employs a multi-scale feature extraction approach using inception modules with different kernel sizes. By incorporating parallel convolutional operations, InceptionV3 can capture both local and global features effectively. This makes it suitable for recognizing complex ASL gestures with varying scales and structures.

The ASL interpreter workflow involves several key steps:
•	Data Collection:  I have taken  a diverse dataset of ASL gesture images, including 36 image folders containing individual folders of 26 english alphabets and numbers 0-9 ensuring sufficient variability in hand shapes, orientations, and backgrounds to improve model robustness.

•	Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the image data to enhance model generalization and mitigate overfitting. Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping can be applied to augment the dataset and split the datasets into training and testing datasets respectively and also visualized the dataset for a better understanding.

•	Model Training: Training DenseNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3 architectures using the prepared dataset. The training process involves optimizing model parameters to minimize prediction errors and maximize accuracy.

•	Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using separate validation datasets. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to evaluate model performance and identify areas for improvement.

•	Comparison of Performance: Comparing performances of the 3 models to find out the most accurate model.

Dataset Link: The dataset used for training and evaluation can be accessed through Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/asl-dataset/data . It is essential to ensure that the dataset is properly annotated and representative of the ASL gesture vocabulary to facilitate effective model learning and interpretation.
